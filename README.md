# Pong

This game requires two UCFK4 (University of Canterbury Fun Kit v4) boards, which contain an [ATmega32u2 microcontroller](http://ecewiki.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/mediawiki/index.php/Atmel_ATmega32u2), a reset push button, a general-purpose pushbutton, a five-way navigation switch, a green LED that indicates if power is on, a user switchable blue LED, a seven by five dot-matrix display, an infrared LED, a 36 kHz infrared receiver, and a USB connector. The USB connector provides 5 V to run the microcontroller and to allow programs to be up-loaded.

_UCFK4 data is per the [University of Canterbury UCFK4 wiki page](http://ecewiki.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/mediawiki/index.php/UCFK4)_
